A JavaEE webapp to generate random sudoku puzzles. The project contains as a subpart a general purpose CSP Solver using Backtracking and Forward Checking.

Problems are generated by starting from a random filled board and removing blocks. A block is not removed if removing it causes more than one solutions to exist. This approach generates reasonably hard probles containg 22 to 26 clues at hard level.

The CSP Solver was built independently and does not depend on the sudoku-problem.
